# SVHN Prediction using DeepNet CNN

1. Street View House Numbers (SVHN) is a real-world image dataset obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

2. Implemented Custom CNN Model with Keras Tuner to tune hyperparameters.

3. Model Accuracy achieved - 81.15%

4. Simple step-by-step process -<br>
   a. Converted '.mat' files to numpy for further assessment and usage using scipy.<br>
   b. Preprocessed the data by reducing channels and normalization.<br>
   c. Developed Custom CNN model using Keras tuner.<br>
   d. Parameter Information -<br>
        Total params: 15,698<br>
        Trainable params: 15,650<br>
        Non-trainable params: 48 (usage of Batch Normalization)<br>
